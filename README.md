## Description

Was tasked with creating a blog page, where all my content is stored on a wordpress installation using a headless cms.
Home page had to have a latest post section which uses a carousel (slider) for a user to click to view more post on bigger screens. On Mobile i just added a view more button.
On the detailed page i created a comment section, where users can post a comment that is sent to the wordpress api, and retrieved and displayed on the comment section.
Was also tasked with creating a img modal, where is the user clicks an image, the image pops up in its own modal. clicking outside the image, closes the modal.
On the contact page when the user sends a message, that message is being sent to the wordpress installation.
